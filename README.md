## 1. System Architecture & Kernel Concepts

### Overview
- **Kernel Basics:** Understand how the Linux kernel abstracts hardware, manages processes, memory, and I/O.
- **/proc and /sys:** These virtual filesystems provide real-time system and kernel information.

### Examples

- **Viewing Kernel Messages:**  
  The `dmesg` command is invaluable for troubleshooting hardware or driver issues.
  ```bash
  dmesg | less
  ```

- **Checking System Information:**  
  Display memory info from a virtual file in `/proc`.
  ```bash
  cat /proc/meminfo | grep MemTotal
  ```

- **Kernel Parameters:**  
  Use `sysctl` to view and modify kernel settings.
  ```bash
  # List current settings
  sysctl -a | less

  # Set a parameter (requires sudo)
  sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
  ```
  
These commands allow you to monitor and even tweak the kernel behavior dynamically—invaluable when resolving performance bottlenecks or configuring network parameters.

## 2. Filesystem Hierarchy & Storage Management

### Overview
- **Filesystem Layout:** Know the FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard)—understand directories like `/etc`, `/var`, `/usr`, `/home`, etc.
- **Storage Management:** LVM, raid arrays, and filesystem types (ext4, xfs, btrfs).

### Examples

- **Listing Disk Usage:**  
  Use `df` and `du` to monitor disk space.
  ```bash
  df -h       # Overview of mounted filesystems with human-readable sizes
  du -sh /var/log  # Get the size of /var/log directory
  ```

- **LVM Management:**  
  Display Logical Volume information.
  ```bash
  sudo lvdisplay
  ```
  
- **Inode Usage:**  
  Check inode usage to diagnose “no space left on device” issues.
  ```bash
  df -i
  ```
  
Having a solid grasp of filesystem concepts ensures data integrity, efficient storage use, and smooth scaling as system demands change.

## 3. Shell Scripting & Automation

### Overview
- **Bash Scripting:** Write robust, reusable scripts for automation, monitoring, and incident response.
- **Error Handling:** Use `set -euo pipefail` to enforce strict error-handling best practices.

### Example Script: Advanced Log Rotation

This script finds log files older than a specified number of days, compresses, and archives them.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# advanced-logrotate.sh
# Purpose: Archive and compress old log files with error handling.

set -euo pipefail

LOG_DIR="/var/log/myapp"
RETENTION_DAYS=7
ARCHIVE_DIR="/var/archive/myapp_logs"

# Create archive directory if not exists
mkdir -p "$ARCHIVE_DIR"

# Find and compress logs older than RETENTION_DAYS
find "$LOG_DIR" -type f -name "*.log" -mtime +$RETENTION_DAYS -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' file; do
    gzip "$file"
    mv "${file}.gz" "$ARCHIVE_DIR"
    echo "Archived: ${file}.gz"
done

echo "Log rotation and archiving completed."
```

This script demonstrates best practices for automation tasks and can be scheduled via cron for routine maintenance.

## 4. Process & Resource Management

### Overview
- **Process Lifecycle:** Learn about forking, the process table, and signals.
- **Utilities:** Manage processes using `ps`, `top`, `htop`, and `systemctl`.

### Examples

- **Process Listing and Filtering:**  
  List all processes related to `nginx`.
  ```bash
  ps aux | grep nginx | grep -v grep
  ```

- **Using `htop`:**
  ```bash
  htop  # Offers an interactive, real-time view of system processes.
  ```

- **Signal Management:**  
  Gracefully restart a process by sending `SIGHUP`.
  ```bash
  kill -HUP <process_id>
  ```

Understanding process management is critical for diagnosing performance issues and ensuring system stability.

## 5. User, Group, and Permissions Management

### Overview
- **User Management:** Creation, deletion, and permission assignments.
- **File Permissions:** Mastering `chmod`, `chown`, and ACLs for advanced permission scenarios.

### Examples

- **Creating a User:**
  ```bash
  sudo adduser deployer
  ```

- **File Ownership and Permissions:**  
  Secure a configuration file:
  ```bash
  sudo chown root:admin /etc/secure.conf
  sudo chmod 640 /etc/secure.conf
  ```

- **Using Access Control Lists (ACLs):**
  ```bash
  # Grant the user 'alice' read permission on /var/shared
  sudo setfacl -m u:alice:r /var/shared
  sudo getfacl /var/shared
  ```

These practices support a secure multi-user environment and are vital for both compliance and operational security.
